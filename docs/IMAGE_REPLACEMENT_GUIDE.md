## Image Replacement Instructions

Please replace the following images in the `public/images/` folder:

1. **Keep**: `dashboard.png` (already renamed from screenshot1.png)
2. **Replace**: `screenshot2.png` with the "Flashcard Interface" screenshot (showing 工作/work)
3. **Replace**: `screenshot3.png` with the "Session Complete" screenshot (showing completion stats)
4. **Add**: Save the "Settings" screenshot as `settings-new.png` (for potential future use)

The updated landing page now uses:
- A large, prominent dashboard screenshot at the top
- A 2-column layout below for better visibility
- Larger image sizes and better hover effects
- More descriptive captions

Current layout:
- Main dashboard: Large, centered, max-width container
- Secondary images: 2-column grid on desktop, stacked on mobile
- All images have improved hover effects and larger text overlays
