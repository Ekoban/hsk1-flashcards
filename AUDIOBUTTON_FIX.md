# ðŸ”§ AudioButton Infinite Loop Fix

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the "Too many re-renders" error in the AudioButton component that was preventing the app from starting properly.

## Root Cause
The infinite loop was caused by:
1. `handleSpeak` function being recreated on every render
2. `azureSpeech.speakWithAzure` changing on every render
3. `useEffect` dependencies causing circular re-renders

## Solution Applied
1. **Stabilized useCallback dependencies:**
   - Removed `azureSpeech.speakWithAzure` from dependencies
   - Kept only primitive values and stable functions

2. **Improved autoPlay logic:**
   - Used refs to store current values
   - Reduced useEffect dependencies to prevent loops

3. **Function reference stability:**
   - Ensured handleSpeak has stable dependencies
   - Prevented unnecessary re-creation of callback functions

## Code Changes
```typescript
// Before (causing infinite loop):
const handleSpeak = React.useCallback(async () => {
  // ... logic
}, [disabled, text, rate, isSupported, speak, azureSpeech.speakWithAzure]);

// After (stable):
const handleSpeak = React.useCallback(async () => {
  // ... logic  
}, [disabled, text, rate, isSupported, speak]);
```

## Testing
âœ… Build completes successfully
âœ… No TypeScript errors
âœ… App should start without infinite render errors

## Verification Steps
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to app (should load without errors)
3. Try audio functionality (should work normally)
4. Check browser console (no render loop errors)

## Status: RESOLVED âœ…
The app should now start properly without the render loop issue.
